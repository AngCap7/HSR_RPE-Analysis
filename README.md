# HSR_RPE-Analysis

This repository contains the results of a statistical analysis conducted on a dataset comprising two primary variables: High Speed Running (HSR) and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) for each training session and for each football player.

Dataset Overview:

Variables:
High Speed Running (HSR): Represents the distance covered by football players at high speeds during training sessions.
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE): Indicates the subjective intensity experienced by players during training sessions.
Analysis Highlights:

Report Construction: Utilizing the dataset, a comprehensive report was generated to evaluate various aspects of training load.
Insights Revealed: The report identifies both positive and negative trends in training loads among players.
Future Implications: Offers potential areas of improvement and recommendations for optimizing training strategies based on the observed patterns.
Repository Contents:

Dataset: Contains the original dataset used for analysis.
Statistical Analysis Script: R or Python script used for data processing and statistical analysis.
Report: Detailed report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
Future Work:

This analysis serves as a foundation for future research and interventions aimed at enhancing training effectiveness and athlete performance. Further investigations may explore additional variables, refine analytical techniques, and implement targeted training interventions based on the findings of this study.

Feel free to explore the repository and review the detailed report for more insights into the analysis of training load and perception among football players. Contributions and feedback are welcomed!
